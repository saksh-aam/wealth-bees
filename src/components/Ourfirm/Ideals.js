Remember in the previous section I mentioned that when you click on a link the component will be placed in the content section. Here we defined the routes for each component. The path "/home" equates to the "Home" component, and when the link in the "side bar" for example is clicked, the component "Home" will be loaded, and placed within the "Layout" component, but the Layout elements remain.</h3></div>
