                <p>Estate Planning refers to the passing down of property, family heirlooms, personal accolades and other assets from one generation to the other. It is a prudent step towards ensuring the financial security of your loved ones and minimizing the legal hassle caused by any unforeseen event. </p>

                <p>We all know that even though we are unaware of the time, death is a certainty. Dying intestate &#40; i.e. without making a legal will &#41; can result in legal disputes, disagreements and bitterness in the family. Therefore, the best way to avoid such complications is to procure a systematic estate plan and determine what happens to your estate after your demise according to your will.</p>

                <p>The process of estate planning is dynamic and needs to be reviewed at regular intervals to reflect any changes that might occur in your personal life or in the laws of the country you reside in. </p>
